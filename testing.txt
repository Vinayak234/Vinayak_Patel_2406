 last testing method is carried out in three steps:

•	The first includes unit testing, 
	where in each module is tested to provide its correctness, validity and determine any missing operations and to verify whether the objectives have been met. 
	
•	The second step includes Integration testing.
	It need not be the case, the software whose modules when run individually and showing perfect results, will also show perfect results when run. 
	The individual modules are clipped under this major module and tested again and verified the results.

•	The final step involves validation and testing which determines which the software functions as the user expected. 
	Here also some modifications were. In the completion of the project it is satisfied fully by the end user
