My company name is Virtualwear. Currently, we have one location in New York City. Total number of employees would be 15.
Virtualwear will provide the luxury to the general consumer to envision themselves in clothing before they even try it.
The product will be like looking in a mirror with a full 360 degrees scan of yourself with the desired clothing.
